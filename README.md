Objective:

This project is a security system prototype developed using an Arduino UNO. The system is designed to detect unauthorized access or theft attempts and provide an immediate alert.

How it Works:
✅ The Ultrasonic Distance Sensor  continuously measures the distance in front of it.
✅ If an object comes within 200 cm, it detects the unusual activity.
✅ Immediately, the Buzzer  starts ringing, and the LED  begins blinking as an alert signal.
✅ This ensures quick response and awareness when a possible thief or intruder approaches. 

 Tools & Components Used:

📍Arduino UNO 
📍Ultrasonic Distance Sensor 
📍LED 
📍Buzzer 
 Wokwi Simulator (Online Arduino Simulation Tool) 

 This system helps in giving a quick warning signal when a thief is near, ensuring safety and awareness in real-time.
